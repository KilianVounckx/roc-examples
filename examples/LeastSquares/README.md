# Least Square Difference

This is a Roc solution for the following [Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares) problem.

> *Write a program that prints the least positive integer number `n`, where the difference of `n*n` and `(n-1)*(n-1)` is greater than 1000.*

## Output 

```
% roc run main.roc      
The least positive integer n, where the difference of n*n and (n-1)*(n-1) is greater than 1000, is 501
```

Run unit tests with `roc test main.roc`

## Code
```roc
file:main.roc
```
