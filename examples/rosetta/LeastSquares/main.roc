## A recursive function that takes an `U32` as its input and returns the least
## positive integer number `n`, where the difference of `n*n` and `(n-1)*(n-1)`
## is greater than 1000.
##
## The input `n` should be a positive integer, and the function will return an
## `U32`representing the least positive integer that satisfies the condition.
