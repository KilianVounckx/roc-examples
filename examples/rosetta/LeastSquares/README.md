# Rosetta Code - Least Square Difference

This is a Roc solution for the [Rosetta Code Find Square Difference Problem](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Find_square_difference)

> *Find the least positive integer number `n`, where the difference of `n*n` and 
`(n-1)*(n-1)` is greater than 1000.*

## Output 

```
% roc run main.roc      
The least positive integer n, where the difference of n*n and (n-1)*(n-1) is greater than 1000, is 501
```

Run unit tests with `roc test main.roc`

## Code
```roc
file:main.roc
```
